#-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is our code design document where we will describe overall architecture of the system and document any problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------#

NOTE: This is a living document and will be continually updated to reflect the current design of the system and our progress towards that design
      Also, we will have a UML diagram soon!


Section 1: Design

- The core game will have a over arching module (referenced as the "director" in this document) that runs in the background
- This director will manage the menu system, map/player/enemy spawning, and save states/win conditions and other globally triggered events
- There will be a general AI manager that the director will talk to that is responsible for all of the actions of enemies, bosses, and friendly NPCs
- There will be a weapon manager that the director will talk to that will handle all of the weapon changing dynamics
- All other scripts that will be attached to the player directly will be described in more detail later on

	section 1a: Director
		- More detail to come


	section 1b: AI Manager
		- More detail to come


	section 1c: Dynamic Weapon Evolution Manager
		- More detail to come



Section 2: Challenges/Problems

- As of right now, the biggest hurdle will be creating the core AI and dynamic weapon evolution manager
- More problems/challenges and our solutions to them will be continually posted here
